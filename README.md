# Bank Loan Default Risk Analysis

This repository presents a comprehensive data analysis case study focused on understanding the key drivers behind loan default in the banking sector.

### Objectives
- Identify major financial indicators leading to loan defaults.
- Perform statistical hypothesis testing on selected features.
- Visualize key insights using Power BI dashboards.

### Tools & Techniques
- **Python** for data transformation and statistical analysis
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy** for EDA and hypothesis testing
- **Power BI** for creating interactive visual dashboards

### Key Insights
- Individuals with lower income and higher loan amounts are more likely to default.
- Interest rates above 17% show a higher chance of default.
- Statistical tests confirmed that these features significantly differ between defaulters and non-defaulters.

### Repository Structure
- `data/` - Cleaned datasets
- `notebooks/` - EDA and hypothesis testing scripts
- `powerbi/` - Dashboard files
- `README.md` - Project overview

### Status
